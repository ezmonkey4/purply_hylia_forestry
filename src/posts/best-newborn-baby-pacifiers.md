Are looking for a pacifier for you newborn baby? For most babies it is a matter of finding the right pacifier. All babies are different and what works for someone else might not work for your baby.



We feel different pacifiers have different purposes. We will list the best pacifiers that cover different cases so that you can find which one might fit you and your baby best.

Just so you know, if you click on a product on PurplyPacifier.com and decide to buy it, we may earn a small commission.


# Considerations
Each pacifier in this list will have advantages over the others. Some babies are easier and will go with a more standard pacifier, but others will need a more careful selection from the parent. This list looks at what makes a pacifier special.

The pacifiers on this list are all made of silicone (except the last one that is made of rubber). All the pacifiers presented are BPA free.
We will not focus on wether a pacifier is orthodontic or not as we have reached the conclusion that this will not have any impact on your newborn baby. Orthodontic pacifiers are slightly relevant but only after your baby already has some teeth.

This pacifier stands out for its feature to glow in the dark. At first I thought this was just cool but the great benefit is that you won’t have to turn on the light to find where it fell off. Plenty a times we will have pacifiers in the crib that were left there from a previous time, and this helps us find it quickly in the dark.
To have it glow in the dark we do need to put it under a light for a moment. Note that you don’t have to keep them in the sun during the day, In fact you just need to hold them under a strong lamp for a few seconds.
The glow is not too bright and will not prevent the newborn from sleeping. It may not last the whole night, but it lasts for the first stage where the baby struggles to fall asleep.

Apart from its glow, the MAM pacifiers use their SkinSoft textured silicone that “feels like mom” and they feature the standard holes on the shield to keep airflow and prevent skin irritation.

Their shape makes it easier for the baby to keep it in the mouth.

I’ll straight away give my opinion for the Philips Avent Soothie. These have the same shape as the ones that the nurses have in the hospitals to give to the newborn babies right after delivery. I don’t know if that is the reason, but some babies seem to prefer this shape, possibly because they are already familiar with it.

The Philips Avent Soothie pacifier is made of a strong and smooth silicone. Its shape is an elongated cylinder with a small protrusion at the top to help keep it in the babies mouth.

In the hospital I usually see the nurses put their finger in the hollow nipple while trying to comfort the baby with this pacifier. It helps them connect to the baby a bit more since they will feel something that “is alive” instead of feeling that they are being shoved a piece of silicone in their mouth.

These are the least expensive pacifier for newborns in this list.

## 3. Itzy Ritzy Sweetie Soother Pacifier

### Key Features
Pros: Softer than other brands

(there are several versions with different rings and colors)

The Itzy Ritzy Sweetie Soother differs from the rest because of both its material and the back ring.

Even though the nipple of this pacifier looks similar to the Philips Avent, these ones are actually softer and more flexible. Some babies will prefer them for that reason.

The pacifier ring has cute patterns, ranging from a rope, to bow-ties, along with a selection of colors.

The ring is part of the pacifier as a single piece. As the babies grow they will transition to grabbing the pacifier and chewing its ring section when they start teething.

### Key Features
Pros: Has a plushie attached!

Good for:

Baby Age: 0-3 Months
Shape: Uniform Cilinder
Material: Silicone
Quantity: 2

Click the picture of the animal you are interested in to see on Amazon.

The pacifier portion is the same as the Phillips Avent Pacifier with an attached plushie from WubbaNub. The pacifier and the toy are attached and cannot be separated.

The reason some babies prefer this pacifier is for the fact that there’s a fluffy toy attached! Some children get comfort from hugging the plushie.

Also, if your baby seems to like the Phillips Avent Soothie but keeps losing or dropping it from its mouth, getting a WubbaNub may be a good choice since the extra volume and weight from the plushie helps keep it in place and not roll off.

There are many different plushies, I’ve added the most popular ones. The Ones with the caterpillar are made by Mary Meyer, and the caterpillar link will feature other flashy animals if you want something more bright.

## 5. RaZbaby JollyPop Baby Pacifier Newborn

### Key Features
Pros: Same as Soothie

Baby Age: 0-3 Months
Shape: Uniform Cilinder
Material: Silicone

This pacifier has the same shape as the Phillips Soothie, but the shield is not circular and won’t press on the baby’s face as much. It also allows for a pacifier clip to be attached. It is just the soothie, but with some smaller improvements. The price is slightly higher to compensate.

### Key Features
Pros: Short Nipple
Good for: Gag reflex

Baby Age: 0-3 Months
Shape: Uniform Cilinder
Material: Silicone
Quantity: 2

Check on Amazon
(there are several versions with different rings and colors)
This is an alternative short nipple, for the babies that prefer this shape instead of the cylinder shape. You would pick this pacifier if you had previously tried the MAM pacifier, and your baby liked it but unfortunately would get a gagging reflex from it. The gag reflex most of the times are from the size of the pacifier, some newborns are more sensitive and more prone to gagging, so for those we would recommend either these MAM Start Newborn Pacifiers, or the previous one on this list

As we mentioned, the MAM have the SoftSkin silicone that is soft, and its shape also helps keep the pacifier in the baby’s mouth.

This particular one is lightweight and small, but still has big gaps on its shield for airflow.

I have this pacifier on the list and it gives me memories. I have no idea at this point what pacifier model I had as a baby myself, but I remember it was a rubber pacifier, and I liked it. I used it until I was 3 years old.

This is a pacifier made of rubber, which is made from a tree’s sap.
Rubber is softer than silicone, and I may be biased here, but it is very comforting.

The design of this pacifier includes a big shield, with the idea of it touching the baby’s nose to give him or her some extra comfort, mimicking their mama’s breast. As mentioned, the rubber is more flexible than silicone, so the pressure on the nose won’t squish it. (There’s also a version with the “butterfly” shield so that it won’t hit the baby’s nose).
