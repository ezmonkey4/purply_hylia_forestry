An exquisite scene:

As with most things in life, there is a beginning. Life start, after a long wait and with great effort (from Mom!).
And lo and behold, a new baby arrives! Now, take rest little one, your family will be there for you.

Suddenly we warp to a plane about to take off… The flight attendant has started gesturing as some voice chirpily carries on the background. “… your seatbelt on …”. No one seems to pay much attention as you look around “…an oxygen mask will drop…”. Why did we come to an airplane anyway? “… fix your own mask before helping others.”

And we are zoomed back! The family and the baby are here now.

Taking care of our newborn baby is hard! It is a non-stop routine of feeding, burping, changing diapers, sometimes cleaning what spilled from the diapers… Fun!

In my opinion, the most important thing when taking care of someone else is to also take care of ourselves. Whenever we take a commercial flight we will be reminded (every single time…) that we need to put on our mask before we can help someone else with their mask. Along those lines, to be able to care for someone else, someone completely new to this world, It is important for us take care of ourselves as well and to try to have some rest.

Nowadays it is even harder to take a moment to rest and have some peace, with everything around us that tries to take our attention. There are still bills to pay, there may be other kids to take care of, there is extended family wanting to visit, there are shows that we want to watch, there’s dishes that need to be done, bathroom breaks(!), etc.

We hope that a pacifier will be able to help you at some of those times. It is hard to rest when we have our child crying, and Mom needs rest to be able to recover physically and mentally.
A pacifier may also help Dad since he has less “tools” than Mom to comfort his new baby.

With this site we hope that you can get more informed about pacifiers. It takes a long time to do research about newborns. Everyone has opinions and there are a lot of people (and a lot of opinions). The internet is full of contradictions and we always try to weed them out to make decisions based on all that we read. We hope that this site will help you reach conclusions faster, so that you have to spend less time awake trying to read what is the “right” thing to do. We sure did spend a bunch of time on our first kid.
